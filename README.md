Soccer analytics has gained its own craze in today's society. Be it for the media or the team managements, people make their assumptions on the basis of the numerical facts that is obtained from a football match. In this analysis we tried to perform frame couple of analytical obsrvation which goes deeper into a soccer match. 


##### The Data
The data has been collected from the website https://figshare.com/collections/Soccer_match_event_dataset/4415000 where we collected the data related to the matches, the teams, the players, the coaches and various events related to different nations. There were several goals of this analysis. First we dealt with the premier league teams. In the file ADM_HW_RQ1, we have tried to show which team tends to win most. We made a plot which exhibits the points of the teams over the weeks. Later on we tried to find out the longest winning and losing streak of the teams.


The folder ADM_HW2_RQ2,RQ3,CRQ2 deals with few other question which were described as RQ2, RQ3 and CRQ2 in the question. The RQ2 deals with the association between the teams' win vs the venue of the match. RQ3 deals with the teams and the age of the coaches. In other words, it finds the teams which are having youngest coaches. and CR2 focuses specifically on the match played between Barcelona and Real Madrid on 6th of May, 2018.


ADM_RQ4 answers to the question of the efficiency of the players. We have created a table which allows us to check the 10 players with highest frequency.
