Soccer analytics has gained its own craze in today's society. Be it for the media or the team managements, people make their assumptions on the basis of the numerical facts that is obtained from a football match. In this analysis we tried to perform frame couple of analytical obsrvation which goes deeper into a soccer match. 


##### The Data
The data has been collected from ['this website'](https://figshare.com/collections/Soccer_match_event_dataset/4415000) where we collected the data related to the matches, the teams, the players, the coaches and various events related to different nations. The analysis had several research goals.

## RQ1
The goal was to have a visualization of the weekly ranking of Premier League during 2017/18 season. Also, with this research it came out that the team with the longest winning streak was Manchester City, and the team with longest lose streak was West Bromwich. The same research was repeated over four other european leagues, i.e. Freanch, Spanish, Italian and German first divisions.
Research realized by Debodeep.  

## RQ2
In this research, the goal was to verify the common belief that playing home or away influences a team's result in a match. This belief was proven valid for Premier league through a Chi-Squared test of independence, but not as general as one might exect. In fact, the relationship between the side and the result has proven weak for Liga and Serie A teams.

## RQ3
Here, the goal was to get a quick insight over coaches'age in Premier League. In particular, a ranking of teams with the youngest coach (during a portion of or the whole season) was made. Also, coaches'age distribution was visualized through a box-plot.

## RQ4
The goal here was to evaluate efficiency of Premier League players at passing. We have built a table which allowed us to check the 10 players with highest pass success ratios. The same analysis was repeated over Freanch, Spanish, Italian and German first divisions.

## RQ5
Our goal was to verify if there exists a relationship between the height of a player of Premier League and his ability at winning air duels. This relationship proved quite strong, and was visualized through a scatterplot of these two variables. The same analysis was repeated over Spanish and Italian first divisions, and same conclusions were drawn. 
Research realized by Simone

## RQ6
We wanted to investigate the relationship existing between age of a player and his passing efficiency. This can be seen as an extension of RQ4. A relationship of dependence was found through a Chi-Squared test of independence, and through a barplot was shown that ratio of successful passes increases with age of a player.

## CRQ1
This core research wanted to investigate the distribution of goals over timespan of matches. In particular, a barplot over equal ranges of time (except for the stoppage times) showed that goals are distributed almost uniformly during the match, although a light concentration of goals in the second half of a match can be sensed. After this, a ranking was made between teams who scored the most during the last 10 minutes of a game, and at last, we wanted to show players that were able to score at least one goal in 8 different intervals (of ten minutes) of a match.

## CRQ2
The goal was to visualize the positions covered by Ronaldo and Messi during a specific match (Barcelona-Real Madrid played in May 2018) through a heatmap. Then, analyzing the match between Juventus and Napoli, we wanted to visualize positions and directions of passes made by Jorginho and Pjanic, and this was done through an arrow-map. Both maps were applied to a scaled version of the football pitch.

### In the repository can be found the Jupyter Notebook ['main.ipynb'](https://github.com/Simonerc95/ADM-HW2/blob/master/main.ipynb), in which all the results of RQ's and CRQ's analysis can be found.

### In the file ['theory.ipynb'](https://github.com/Simonerc95/ADM-HW2/blob/master/theory.ipynb), a computation of the execution time of a function called SplitSwap can be found.
